Welcome to PyOPERA's documentation!
===================================
**PyOPERA** (/py'opera/) is a Python wrapper around the library generated by `OPERA <https://github.com/niehs/opera/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.

The `OPERA <https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/niceatm/comptox/ct-opera/opera.html>`_ app was developed by the NIH to run Quantitative structureâ€“activity/property relationship 
(QSAR/QSPR) models. QSAR models provide a way to predict chemical toxicology without the need of animal models (Madden et al., 2020). The NIH project spun off 
`a repo of OPERA models <https://github.com/kmansouri/OPERA>`_ using MATLAB, this project uses the output of the NIH OPERA open-source project and converts it to a full Python package 
that is as usable as possible by Python developers.
